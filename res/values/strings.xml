        You are Mr. Joe Weeder, the proud owner of the most beautiful grass field in all of the district. Unfortunately, dandelions
        keep popping up out of nowhere. Your job: remove these pesky flowers before they cover your entire field. But you have to work
        quickly. If you don\'t get them
        before they start spreading their seeds, even more dandelions will appear. It is a lost race, but how long can you keep your field
        clean?\n\nGame and visual art created by Softnez\nMusic from http://www.uniquetracks.com/Free-Music-Loops.html
